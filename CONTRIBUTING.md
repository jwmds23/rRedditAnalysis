# Contributor Guidelines



### Core Contributors

- All contributors should work locally at Kelowna and push into their respective branches.

- When a contributor wants to merge with the *main* branch, they must ask for permission from peers in the team before the merge.

- **Requirements for merging a PR:**
    - All pull requests must pass the TravisCI build in order to be merged.
    - All pull requests must make sure no conflict before the merge. If there is a conflict, it has to be solved gracefully before the merge.
    - All code must pass `devtools::check()` without errors before being merged.
